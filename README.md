This file is about taking a message and putting it through a cipher of the user's choice. Also comes with what each cipher does.
Remember to keep at least one hashtag on, either on line 121 or 122. To see what each cipher does, remove the hastag off line 121. To use the ciphers, remove the hashtag off line 122.
I will leave decrypting for another day. The code is finished.
